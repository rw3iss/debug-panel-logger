- benchmark the diffing algorithm vs normal replace.
- currently the dom updates are not done through the diff/patch, fix.
- make debug first arg identifier optional
- allow debug to support array args?

- combine DebugPanel & LogModule Options for DebugPaneLogModule

- export JsonView?
- export 'autoexpand' JsonView options in DebugPanel (ie. some rules to always expand certain nodes)

- LogEvents and in general namespaces need better filtering in/out of clients
